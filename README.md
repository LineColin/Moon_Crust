# Moon's Crust Formation
Numerical modeling of the formation of the lunar crust. These simple scripts give an overview of the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean from the advection diffusion equation. The Moon is supposed to crystallize uniformly at the top and bottom. .

- CumulatsFormation.py

Function library that allows to model the formation of the first crystallization of solid cumulates. 

- CrustFormation.py

Function library that allows to model the formation of solid cumulates and anorthosite crust.



## Requirements
These scripts need the following packages to run : `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy.sparse.linalg`.
