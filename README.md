# Moon's Crust Formation
Numerical modeling of the formation of the lunar crust. These simple scripts give an overview of the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean from the advection diffusion equation. The Moon is supposed to crystallize uniformly at the top and bottom.

- CrustFormation.py

Function library

- CrustFormation_figures.py

Executable that produces different figures : evolution of the radius of the crust and solid cumulates, temperature and distribution of radiogenic elements in the crust and different fluxes.

## Requirements
These scripts need the following packages to run : `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy.sparse.linalg`.
